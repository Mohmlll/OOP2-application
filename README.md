# OOP2
This was my very first Object Oriented app.
The goal was to make a make a simple console based JavaFX application with a list.

At OOP1 I learned to apply my programming knowledge in a objected oriented way and now I have to applied that knowledge with A GUI.
I was free to design the application how ever we wanted as long as I followed the assignment.

I had to create a master and a detail view. Each view had its own model, view and controller.

I used 3 different types of data access objects to register the data in my application.
- The first one was a dummy data dao
- The 2nd one was a text dao
- The final one was a binary dao

Further I learned how to use comparators and how to work with models, views and controllers.

I was given an 8 as grade for this module.
